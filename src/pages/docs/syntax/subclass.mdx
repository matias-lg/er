# Subclasses/Superclasses
  It is possible to associate different entity types by declaring a subclass/superclass relationship. This is done using the `extends` keyword when declaring
  an entity. The following example shows the subclass "Dog" and the superclass "Animal". 

  ```erdoc
  entity Animal {
    id key
    age
    location: [latitude, longitude]
  }

  entity Dog extends Animal {
    name
    breed
  } 
  ```

  <Callout>
  Subclass entities can't have a key attribute! This is a semantic restriction of the ER model.
  </Callout>

  The generated ER diagram will contain the special `IsA` relationship between the superclass and the subclass.

  You can nest subclasses as deep as you want. The generated ER diagrams will follow a tree-like layout.

   If an entity extends one of its subclasses, an error will be shown in the Playground.

  ```erdoc
  entity Employee {
    name
    id key
    bday
  }

  entity Management_Employee extends Employee {}
  entity Manager extends Management_Employee {}
  entity CEO extends Management_Employee {}
  entity Engineer extends Employee {}
  entity Senior_Engineer extends Engineer {}
  entity Team_Leader extends Senior_Engineer {}
  entity Intern extends Engineer {}
  entity Secretary extends Employee {
    typing_speed
  }
  ```
