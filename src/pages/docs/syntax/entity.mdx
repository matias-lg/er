# Entity expression

An `entity` declaration consists of the keyword "entity" followed by its name, the entity it inherits from (if any), and a list of its attributes.
The following example declares an entity with the name "Dog" which has the attributes "name", "breed", "age" and the key attribute "d_id".
  ```erdoc
  entity Dog {
    d_id key
    name
    breed
    age
  } 
  ```
  ## Entity attributes
  An entity attribute may be declared as a key attribute by adding the keyword `key` after the attribute name. Also, the ERdoc language allows attributes
  to be composite following the `attribute: [part1, part2, partN]` syntax. The following example shows an entity with a composite attribute that is also 
  part of the key of the entity. 
  ```erdoc
  entity Company_Branch {
    company_name key
    address: [street, city, zip] key
    revenue
  }
  ```
