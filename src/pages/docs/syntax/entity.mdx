# Entity expression

An `entity` declaration consists of the keyword "entity" followed by its name, the entity it inherits from (if any), and a list of its attributes.
The following example declares an entity with the name "Dog" which has the attributes "name", "breed", "age" and the key attribute "d_id".
  ```erdoc
  entity Dog {
    d_id key
    name
    breed
    age
  } 
  ```
  ## Entity attributes
  An entity attribute may be declared as a key attribute by adding the keyword `key` after the attribute name. Also, the ERdoc language allows attributes
  to be composite following the `attribute: [part1, part2, partN]` syntax. The following example shows an entity with a composite attribute that is also 
  part of the key of the entity. 
  ```erdoc
  entity Company_Branch {
    company_name key
    address: [street, city, zip] key
    revenue
  }
  ```

  ## Subclasses/Superclasses
  It is possible to associate different entity types by declaring a subclass/superclass relationship. This is done using the `extends` keyword when declaring
  an entity. The following example shows the subclass "Dog" and the superclass "Animal". 

  ```erdoc
  entity Animal {
    id key
    age
    location: [latitude, longitude]
  }

  entity Dog extends Animal {
    name
    breed
  } 
  ```

  <Callout>
  Subclass entities can't have a key attribute! This is a semantic restriction of the ER model.
  </Callout>

  The generated ER diagram will contain the special `IsA` relationship between the superclass and the subclass.

  You can nest subclasses as deep as you want. The generated ER diagrams will follow a tree-like layout.

   If an entity extends one of its subclasses, an error will be shown in the Playground.

  entity Employee {
    name
    id key
    bday
  }

  entity Management_Employee extends Employee {}
  entity Manager extends Management_Employee {}
  entity CEO extends Management_Employee {}
  entity Engineer extends Employee {}
  entity Senior_Engineer extends Engineer {}
  entity Team_Leader extends Senior_Engineer {}
  entity Intern extends Engineer {}
  entity Secretary extends Employee {

  }
