# Aggregation expression

The syntax to define an aggregation -a virtual entity- uses the `aggregation` keyword, followed by the name of the aggregation and the name of the 
relationship to be aggregated surrounded by parenthesis. The following example defines an aggregation named "Human_drinks_coffee" that aggregates the
"Drinks" relationship:

```erdoc
entity Human {
  id key
  name
  age
}

entity Coffee {
  id key
  species
  roast_date
}

relation Drinks(Human, Coffee 1) {
  amount
}

aggregation Human_drinks_coffee(Drinks)
```

Aggregations can be used just as an entity in relationships, identifying them by their name. The following example shows an aggregation participating in a
relationship:

```erdoc
entity Library {
  name key
  address key
}

entity Book {
  bid key
  name
  n_pages
}

entity Author {
  id key
  name
  language
}

relation Writes(Author, Book 1!) {
  took
}

aggregation Book_written_by_Author(Writes)

relation Contains(Library, Book_written_by_Author 1)
```
