# Weak Entity expression


The syntax for weak entities is very similar to the one for entities. To declare an entity as weak, we use the `depends on` keyword followed by the name of
its identifying relationship.
Since weak entities don't have keys but _partial keys_, we use the `pkey` keyword to declare an attribute as part of the partial key of a weak entity.
Weak entities can have [composite attributes](/docs/Syntax/entity#entity-attributes) just as regular entities. Weak entities **can't** extend
other entities.

 In the following example, the weak entity "Assignment" depends on the entity "Course" through the relationship
"isPartOf". See the [syntax for relationships](/docs/Syntax/relationship) in case you don't understand the last line.

<Callout>
A weak entity **must** have total participation in its identifying relationship.
</Callout>

```erdoc
entity Course {
  code key
  c_name
} 

entity Assignment depends on isPartOf {
  a_name pkey
  due_date
}

relation isPartOf(Course, Assignment N!)
```
